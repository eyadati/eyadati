I have created both `terms_of_service.md` and `privacy_policy.md` files in the root of the project, based on the information I gathered from the codebase and the user's request.

I have completed the user's request.

```json
{
  "task": "create 2 files for one has terms of services and the other has privacy policy knowing that the app is currently targets algeria and for firebase seever location i use us-central1",
  "status": "completed"
}
```
