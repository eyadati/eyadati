Execute these tasks in order:

1.change the avatar widget grid view to have 2 standard avatars and the third one will be an upload image widget in a shape of an avatar
2.install needed packages for file picking and then create a supabase function using the bucket "eyadati"
3.change clinic saving data so remove avatar and replace it with picUrl
4.if clinic chooses a default avatar the url will stay the same so no need to upload it to supabase each time
5.remove long and lat from clinic data saving and replace it with mapsLink that will contain google maps link generated using the extracted long and lat
6.run flutter analyze but ignore test errors just detect errors from the previous tasks and solve them
7.commit changes
